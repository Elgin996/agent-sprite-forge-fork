# Generate2dsprite

Use this skill for self-contained 2D sprite or animation assets.

When a larger game or playable prototype needs sprites, use this skill for the visible sprite assets and keep runtime/game assembly separate. Do not replace requested sprite assets with code-drawn placeholders.

## Parameters

Infer these from the user request:

- `asset_type`: `player` | `npc` | `creature` | `character` | `spell` | `projectile` | `impact` | `prop` | `summon` | `fx`
- `action`: `single` | `idle` | `cast` | `attack` | `shoot` | `jump` | `hurt` | `combat` | `walk` | `run` | `hover` | `charge` | `projectile` | `impact` | `explode` | `death`
- `view`: `topdown` | `side` | `3/4`
- `sheet`: `auto` | `2x2` | `2x3` | `2x4` | `3x3` | `3x4` | `4x4` | `5x5` | `custom_grid` | `strip_1x3` | `strip_1x4`
- `frames`: `auto` or explicit count
- `bundle`: `single_asset` | `unit_bundle` | `spell_bundle` | `combat_bundle` | `line_bundle` | `hero_action_bundle` | `engine_atlas`
- `effect_policy`: `all` | `largest`
- `anchor`: `center` | `bottom` | `feet`
- `stabilize_axis`: `none` | `core` | `core-register`
- `scale_strategy`: `fit` | `preserve`
- `scale_profile`: `none` | `create_from_accepted_action` | `reuse_existing`
- `margin`: `tight` | `normal` | `safe`
- `art_style`: pixel_art | clean_hd | pixel_inspired | retro_pixel | map_style | project-native
- `reference`: `none` | `attached_image` | `generated_image` | `local_file`
- `layout_guide`: `none` | `geometry` | `character_anchor`
- `runtime_contract`: `none` | `godot_sprite3d`
- `world_height`: desired in-engine subject height when a runtime contract is requested
- `prompt`: the user's theme or visual direction
- `role`: only when the asset is clearly an NPC role
- `name`: optional output slug

Read [references/modes.md](references/modes.md) when the request is ambiguous.

## Agent Rules

- Decide the asset plan yourself. Do not force the user to spell out sheet size, frame count, or bundle structure when the request already implies them.
- Do not pack unrelated actions into one raw generated sheet just to satisfy a `4x4`, `5x5`, or custom engine atlas. A raw generated sheet should represent one action family, one continuous sequence, one canonical directional locomotion sheet, or one prop/asset pack.
- For controllable heroes, main characters, and high-value player assets with multiple actions, generate separate per-action grid sheets first, QC each action, then deterministically assemble the engine-required atlas only after the grids pass visual review.
- For controllable heroes, main characters, and high-value player body actions, default attack/shoot/cast body sheets to body-only. Do not include large slash arcs, muzzle flashes, projectiles, impact bursts, detached dust, long trails, or wide detached FX in the body sheet. Generate those as separate `fx`, `projectile`, or `impact` sheets and layer them in the game.
- Only include wide attack FX in the same raw body sheet when the target runtime explicitly supports wider per-action cells plus per-action origin/anchor metadata. Otherwise, a wide FX bbox will force the body to shrink inside the fixed cell.
- Horizontal axis stabilization is on by default and every processed sheet ships with it applied. Vertical anchoring alone does not stop horizontal slide: `align=feet` locks the feet line but leaves the body free to drift left/right, because a per-frame feet median moves whenever the stance widens, a foot lifts, or a weapon extends. Do not turn stabilization off for a body sheet.
- Pass `--stabilize-axis none` only for assets whose horizontal travel inside the cell is the animation, such as a travelling projectile, a sweeping FX, or a dash smear. Everything else keeps the default.
- Never let the horizontal anchor come from the frame bbox. A sword, cannon, tail, or cape that grows on one side moves the bbox center, so bbox-centered frames slide by exactly half the extension. The body axis must come from column alpha mass, which de-weights thin protrusions.
- Treat a large stabilization correction as a generation defect, not a fix. Stabilization is a finishing pass; if `qc_summary.stabilize_max_shift_px` exceeds roughly 8-10% of the cell size, the raw sheet drifted and should be regenerated with a stronger centering contract.
- When a grounded hero/player attack must keep an integrated weapon in the body sheet and there is no runtime FX layer, process it with `scale_strategy=preserve` and `align=feet` by default. This preserves raw-cell scale, translates frames to a shared feet line, and avoids bbox-fit shrinking from long swords, spears, weapon trails, capes, or wide melee poses.
- Write the art prompt yourself. Do not default to the prompt-builder script.
- Use built-in `image_gen` for every raw image.
- Do not create raw sprite art with Three.js, Canvas, SVG, HTML/CSS drawing, PIL shape drawing, procedural geometry, placeholder primitives, or code-rendered screenshots. Runtime code may display finished generated assets, and scripts may make layout guides or postprocess generated images, but requested sprite art must originate from built-in `image_gen`.
- When the user provides or implies a visual reference, use built-in image edit/reference semantics only after the reference image is visible in the conversation context. If the reference is a local file, call `view_image` first; do not rely on a filesystem path in the prompt as the visual reference.
- Do not force pixel art when the asset is a map prop for `$generate2dmap` or when the user/project requests a different style. Match the map or reference style first.
- Use the script only as a deterministic processor: magenta cleanup, frame splitting, component filtering, scaling, alignment, QC metadata, transparent sheet export, and GIF export.
- Do not use scripts to generate the creative image prompt. If a legacy prompt-builder command exists, treat it as historical compatibility only, not the normal skill workflow.
- Layout guides are allowed only as deterministic geometry references for image generation. They may show slot count, spacing, centering, and safe padding, but must never define the creative art direction.
- Treat script flags as execution primitives chosen by the agent, not user-facing hardcoded workflow.
- If a generated sheet touches cell edges, drifts in scale, or breaks a projectile / impact loop, either reprocess with better primitive settings or regenerate the raw sheet.
- Do not use raw single-row sheets such as `1x4`, `1x6`, `1x8`, or `1xN` for characters, players, controllable heroes, creatures, NPCs, enemies, summons, animated props, or any asset where a body/subject must stay centered. Single-row raw generation is too likely to drift horizontally and crop inconsistently.
- For animated body assets, use a multi-row grid by default: 4 frames -> `2x2`, 6 frames -> `2x3`, 8 frames -> `2x4`, 9 frames -> `3x3`, 12 frames -> `3x4` or `4x3`, 16 frames -> `4x4`.
- If a game engine needs a final single-row strip or mixed atlas, first generate and QC the action as a multi-row grid, then assemble the delivery strip/atlas deterministically.
- In every animated body grid prompt, require the subject body to stay centered in each cell, full body inside the central 60% to 70% safe area, consistent scale across cells, stable feet/bottom anchor line when applicable, and no limbs, weapons, hair, capes, dust, muzzle flashes, or detached FX crossing cell edges.
- For hero attack body prompts, explicitly require body height and body scale to match the accepted idle/run sheets, stable feet/bottom anchor, weapon kept close enough to avoid widening the body bbox, and no detached slash arc or screen-space attack effect.
- For elongated quadrupeds, serpentine creatures, and actors whose tail or attack extension nearly fills a cell, add a shared-silhouette-envelope contract to action prompts: keep the torso center fixed, keep every pose inside the same central 70% to 72% width/height box, tuck tails and long appendages inward, and express pounces or bites through in-place compression/extension instead of translating the whole body across the cell. "Generous margin" alone is not a reliable containment instruction for these silhouettes.
- For massive grounded bosses, lock the feet and pelvis against lateral translation in idle prompts. Express weight through vertical torso compression, chest/core pulse, shoulder settling, and secondary motion of attached ornaments; do not use whole-body left/right sway as the idle beat.
- For ground-contact environmental FX such as fire, write one explicit shared ignition/baseline coordinate into the prompt and forbid baked ground plates. Treat tip-height variation as animation, not anchor drift; visually verify the contact line and use an FX-specific anchor threshold instead of applying humanoid feet gates.
- For high-value grounded player/hero body actions, prefer a character anchor sheet when consistent scale or feet placement matters: repeat one accepted master frame at the intended size and feet line in every cell, then use that sheet as a scale/root template while asking built-in `image_gen` to change only the poses. Do not use a grounded anchor sheet for jumps, knockback, airborne motion, projectiles, or FX.
- For a multi-action character bundle, create one scale profile from an accepted idle or run sheet, then process every grounded body action with that profile. The profile locks output cell size, one shared raw-cell scale, anchor, trimming, and component rules across actions. Do not choose a new `fit_scale` per action.
- For map prop packs, classify props before choosing a grid. Square `2x2`, `3x3`, and `4x4` packs are only for compact props. Do not put platforms, floors, bridges, walls, ladders, gates, doors, long hazards, wide/tall props, collision-bearing objects, or tileset/strip pieces into square prop packs; use one-by-one, `1x3`/`1x4` strips, custom wide cells, or a tileset-like atlas instead.
- Keep the solid `#FF00FF` background rule unless the user explicitly wants a different processing workflow.

## Workflow

### 1. Infer the asset plan

Pick the smallest useful output.

Examples:

- controllable hero with four directions -> `player` + `player_sheet`
- side-view controllable hero with idle/run/shoot/jump -> `player` + `hero_action_bundle`
  - idle grid sheet, usually `2x2` for 4 frames
  - run grid sheet, usually `2x2` or `2x3` depending on needed frame count
  - shoot grid sheet with body/weapon only, usually `2x2`
  - jump grid sheet, usually `2x2`
  - projectile / muzzle flash as separate assets when needed
  - optional assembled engine atlas after per-action QC
- side-view controllable hero with melee attack -> `player` + `hero_action_bundle`
  - attack body grid sheet, usually `2x2` or `2x3`, body-only
  - slash arc / weapon trail as a separate `fx` sheet when the attack needs a wide visual effect
  - impact spark as a separate `impact` sheet when hits need feedback
- healer overworld NPC -> `npc` + `single_asset` or `unit_bundle`
- large boss idle loop -> `creature` + `idle` + `3x3`
- wizard throwing a magic orb -> `spell_bundle`
  - caster cast sheet
  - projectile loop
  - impact burst
- monster line request -> `line_bundle`
  - plan 1-3 forms
  - per form, make the sheets the request actually needs

### 2. Write the prompt manually

Use [references/prompt-rules.md](references/prompt-rules.md).

Choose `art_style` before writing the prompt:

- Use `pixel_art` or `retro_pixel` for classic sprites, 16-bit RPG actors, and requests that explicitly ask for pixel art.
- Use `clean_hd` for map props or assets intended to match clean hand-painted HD maps.
- Use `pixel_inspired` only when the user wants a pixel-adjacent look without retro chunkiness.
- Use `map_style` or `project-native` when an existing map, game, or reference should define the style.

If a reference is involved:

- Make the reference visible first. For local paths, use `view_image`; for freshly generated references, rely on the image already shown in context.
- State the reference role explicitly: preserve identity/style, create an animation sheet for the same subject, create an evolution/variant, or derive a matching prop/FX.
- Preserve the stable identity markers from the reference: silhouette, palette, face/eye features, costume marks, major accessories, and material language.
- Let only the requested action or evolution change. Do not redesign the subject unless the user asks.
- Still require exact sheet shape, solid magenta background, frame containment, and same scale across frames.

Keep the strict parts:

- solid `#FF00FF` background
- exact sheet shape
- same character or asset identity across frames
- same camera distance and standing-equivalent anatomical scale across body frames; natural pose bboxes may change, but the model must not zoom individual poses
- explicit containment: nothing may cross cell edges

Mixed-action atlas guardrail:

- Do not ask `image_gen` to generate unrelated action rows in one raw sheet, such as `row 1 idle, row 2 run, row 3 shoot, row 4 jump`, for a controllable hero or main character.
- Do not ask `image_gen` to generate raw single-row action strips such as `1x4 idle`, `1x4 run`, `1x4 shoot`, or `1x4 jump` for a controllable hero, character, creature, NPC, enemy, summon, or animated prop.
- If an engine needs a combined `4x4`, `5x5`, custom atlas, or row-strip delivery format, generate the action grids separately, process and QC them separately, then assemble the delivery atlas deterministically.
- Exceptions are canonical directional locomotion sheets, one continuous long action sequence, prop packs, tileset-like atlases, and low-stakes compact enemy combat sheets. These still need one coherent prompt and visual QC.
- Keep projectile, muzzle flash, impact, dust trails, and detached FX in separate sheets unless they are intentionally part of the same action silhouette and remain tightly attached.
- For controllable heroes and main characters, "tightly attached" is not enough when the effect makes the action bbox much wider or taller than idle/run. Split wide slash arcs, muzzle flashes, long weapon trails, dust clouds, and impact bursts into separate FX sheets by default.

Animated body grid guardrail:

- `1x4` and other raw single-row sheets are not valid defaults for animated bodies. This includes players, controllable heroes, creatures, NPCs, enemies, summons, animated props, and body-attached combat actions.
- Use `2x2` for 4-frame body actions. This is the default for idle, short attack, shoot body, jump, hurt, hover, and compact side-view walk/run actions.
- Use `2x3` for 6-frame body actions such as cast, attack, summon, run, charge, or transformation.
- Use `2x4`, `3x3`, `3x4`, or `4x4` for longer body actions. Prefer a compact grid over a long row.
- For 4-direction top-down walk, `4x4` can remain a raw generation shape because it is a canonical directional locomotion sheet, not four unrelated action rows.
- If final runtime needs a row strip, assemble it after QC from the processed multi-row grid frames.
- Keep the character centered in every cell. The body centerline should stay near the cell center, feet/bottom anchor should stay on the same y-position when visible, and the subject should occupy only the central safe area with generous magenta padding.
- For attack, shoot, cast, charge, and other body actions, the body height should stay close to the accepted idle/run body height. If a fixed-cell runtime is being used, reject body-action output when the body appears more than about 10-15% smaller than idle/run, even if `edge_touch_frames` is empty.

Map prop pack guardrail:

- Use square `2x2`, `3x3`, and `4x4` raw prop packs only for compact props such as rocks, shrubs, barrels, crates, lamps, small signs, pots, debris, and small ornaments.
- Do not use square prop packs for wide or collision-critical map objects: floors, platforms, ledges, terrain chunks, bridges, wall runs, ladders, roads, rails, pipes, long spike traps, gates, doors, buildings, large trees, checkpoints, exits, or build pads.
- Use one-by-one generation for unique, large, important, tall, irregular, or collision-aligned props.
- Use `1x3` or `1x4` strips for repeatable platform/floor assets, with left cap, middle repeat, right cap, and optional slope/corner/end variant.
- Use custom wide cells for multiple similar wide objects. The grid must state explicit non-square cell dimensions and must not mix compact props with platform/terrain objects.
- If a square prop pack fails due to edge touch or bad cropping, do not solve it by relaxing QC. Reclassify the object and regenerate with a more suitable sheet shape.

If a layout guide is useful, generate one before calling built-in `image_gen`:

```bash
python scripts/make_layout_guide.py \
  --rows <rows> \
  --cols <cols> \
  --cell-width 384 \
  --cell-height 384 \
  --output <run-dir>/references/<rows>x<cols>-layout-guide.png
```

Then make the guide visible in the conversation context and tell `image_gen` to use it only for invisible slot count, spacing, centering, and safe padding. The output must not reproduce guide boxes, safe-area rectangles, center marks, labels, borders, or guide background.

Use layout guides deliberately:

- recommended for `prop_pack_3x3`, `prop_pack_4x4`, tileset-like atlases, fixed multi-row animation grids, and non-directional 16-frame action sequences such as casting, summoning, charging, death, or transformation
- optional for `3x3` large idle and high-value showcase loops when previous generations drift in scale or spacing
- not the default for `4x4` four-direction walk sheets, because the guide can make directional poses too conservative; use it only after an unguided run fails layout or edge safety

For grounded high-value character actions, an abstract box guide is weaker than a character anchor sheet. After accepting a neutral/idle master frame, create the anchor sheet:

```bash
python scripts/make_anchor_layout.py \
  --input <accepted-master-frame.png> \
  --rows 2 \
  --cols 3 \
  --cell-width 512 \
  --cell-height 512 \
  --subject-height-ratio 0.66 \
  --feet-ratio 0.82 \
  --output <run-dir>/references/attack-anchor-2x3.png
```

Make both the master frame and anchor sheet visible to built-in `image_gen`. State that the master locks identity/style and the anchor sheet locks slot positions, camera distance, standing-equivalent scale, body root, feet line, and padding. Ask the model to change only the action poses and never reproduce guides, borders, labels, or separators.

### 3. Generate the raw image

Use built-in `image_gen`.

Do not use Three.js, Canvas, SVG, HTML/CSS, PIL drawing, or other code-generated art as the raw sprite source. These are acceptable only for runtime display, debug overlays, deterministic layout guides, or postprocessing already-generated images.

After generation:

- resolve the raw image to a stable local file path before postprocessing
- prefer an explicit file path returned by `image_gen` when one is available
- otherwise find the raw PNG under `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/...` or `~/.codex/generated_images/...`, and only accept files that correspond to the current generation call, not a stale latest file
- if `image_gen` does not return a stable file path and the generated-images directories do not contain the current output, inspect the current session's `image_generation_call.result` for base64 image data (`b64_json`, a `data:image/...;base64,...` URL, or raw base64), immediately decode it into the current run's `generated_images/` directory, and use that decoded file path
- keep the original generated image in place

This fallback is especially important on Windows and non-Codex desktop sessions, where `image_gen` may display the generated image in chat without writing a current PNG into the expected generated-images directory.

Use the helper when the current result must be decoded:

```bash
python skills/generate2dsprite/scripts/save_imagegen_result.py \
  --input <current-session.jsonl-or-image-generation-result.json> \
  --output-dir <run-dir>/generated_images
```

When given a session JSONL, the helper uses the latest `image_generation_call.result` in that file and ignores unrelated data URLs from other tool output. If the result is only available as raw base64 or a data URL, pass it on stdin instead of `--input`. Do not call the local processor with a guessed path or an older generated image. If neither a current file nor base64 image bytes are available, stop and report that the raw image bytes are inaccessible.

### 4. Postprocess locally

Run `scripts/generate2dsprite.py process` on the raw image.

The processor is intentionally low-level. The agent chooses:

- `rows` / `cols`
- `fit_scale`
- `align`
- `stabilize_axis`
- `shared_scale`
- `component_mode`
- `component_padding`
- `scale_strategy`
- `edge_touch` rejection strategy

Custom-grid frame prefixes are filename text, not paths: they are trimmed and slugged, while empty values, path separators, absolute/drive-qualified paths, control characters, and Windows device names are rejected before output files are written.

Use the processor to gather QC metadata, not to make aesthetic decisions for you.

For hero action bundles, process each action grid as its own sheet before any final atlas assembly. Use `component_mode=largest` for body-only hero grids. Use `component_mode=all` only for projectile, impact, aura, slash FX, or intentionally detached FX sheets, not for fixed-cell hero body attacks that need stable body scale.

Use `--scale-strategy preserve --align feet` for grounded hero/player body sheets when the raw art already has acceptable scale but bbox-fit would shrink the character because of a long weapon, extended pose, cape, or integrated melee effect. Preserve mode applies one uniform raw-cell-to-output scale to every frame, including one shared safety margin, then translates each detected subject to the shared anchor. It never applies a different bbox-fit scale per frame. Use the default `fit` strategy for compact bodies, creatures, projectiles, impacts, and intentionally normalized FX.

#### Kill horizontal slide

`align=feet` and `scale_strategy=preserve` fix vertical drift and scale drift, but the subject can still slide left and right between frames. This is the most common remaining quality defect in generated attack, cast, and run sheets, and it is a processing problem, not only a prompt problem.

`process` therefore runs `--stabilize-axis core-register` by default, so frames, `sheet-transparent.png`, `animation.gif`, and `godot-sprite3d.json` are all already stabilized. The flags below only need to appear when changing that behavior:

```bash
python scripts/generate2dsprite.py process \
  --input <raw-sheet.png> \
  --target player --mode attack --rows 4 --cols 4 \
  --output-dir <out-dir> \
  --cell-size 256 --fit-scale 0.88 \
  --align feet --scale-strategy preserve --component-mode largest \
  --strict-qc --max-body-scale-cv 0.08 --max-anchor-y-std 0.05 --max-axis-x-std 0.01
```

How the axis is found:

- Each frame is reduced to per-column alpha mass, then the axis is the mass-weighted median. A dense torso outweighs a thin cannon, sword, tail, or cape, so an extension that grows across the animation barely moves the axis. A bbox center would move by half the extension.
- The estimate is then mode-seeked toward the densest column cluster, so an off-center detached element cannot pull it.
- `core-register` adds a bounded refinement pass that maximizes silhouette overlap against the mean of all aligned frames, limited to `--stabilize-register-window` pixels. The bound matters: unbounded registration walks the subject away whenever the silhouette changes.
- The shared axis lands on the cell center, so it matches `output_origin` and `godot-sprite3d.json`'s `sprite3d_offset`. This also aligns separate action sheets with each other: idle, run, and attack all put the body root on the same point, so a runtime animation switch cannot jump the character sideways.
- Frames are translated by whole pixels only, so pixel art stays crisp, and translation is clamped so a correction can never push a subject into the cell edge.

Flags worth changing:

- `--stabilize-axis none` disables the pass. Reserve it for travelling projectiles and sweeping FX.
- `--stabilize-target mean` keeps the sheet's own average axis instead of the cell center. It moves frames less, but breaks the cross-action alignment above, so prefer the default for anything with a runtime contract.
- `--stabilize-band-top` / `--stabilize-band-bottom` restrict the axis measurement to part of the subject, top-relative. Use `0.0 0.55` for a character whose legs move much more than the torso.
- `--stabilize-strength` below `1.0` keeps some of the original motion. Use it when an attack has an intentional lunge that full alignment would flatten.
- `--max-stabilize-shift` caps the correction, defaulting to 15% of the cell size. Under `--strict-qc`, hitting the cap fails QC, because a sheet needing that much correction should be regenerated.

To fix frames that are already processed, without regenerating or re-running the full pipeline:

```bash
python scripts/generate2dsprite.py stabilize \
  --frames-dir <run-dir> --prefix attack --rows 4 --cols 4 --duration 80
```

This writes corrected frames, `sheet-transparent.png`, `animation.gif`, and `stabilize-meta.json` into `<run-dir>/stabilized/`. Pass `--in-place` or `--output-dir` to choose a different destination.

For a character with multiple actions, write a scale profile only after an accepted reference action passes QC:

```bash
python scripts/generate2dsprite.py process \
  --input <accepted-run-raw.png> \
  --target player --mode run --rows 2 --cols 3 \
  --output-dir <run-dir> \
  --cell-size 128 --fit-scale 0.80 \
  --align feet --scale-strategy preserve --component-mode largest \
  --strict-qc --write-scale-profile <bundle>/character-scale-profile.json \
  --profile-name <character-name> --max-profile-scale-drift 0.08
```

Process later actions with `--scale-profile <bundle>/character-scale-profile.json`. Profile values override per-command scale, anchor, trim, and component defaults so actions cannot silently use different output magnification. Keep using the same generation grid geometry and character anchor sheet when possible; a processing profile cannot repair a model-generated anatomy-scale change.

When integrating a processed grid as a Godot `Sprite3D`, request a world-height contract instead of hand-tuning each action in the game:

```bash
python scripts/generate2dsprite.py process \
  --input <raw-sheet.png> \
  --target player --mode idle --rows 2 --cols 3 \
  --output-dir <action-dir> \
  --cell-size 256 --fit-scale 0.84 \
  --align feet --scale-strategy preserve --component-mode largest \
  --strict-qc --max-body-scale-cv 0.08 --max-anchor-y-std 0.05 \
  --duration 125 --godot-world-height 0.70
```

This writes `godot-sprite3d.json` beside the frames. The reference action derives `recommended_pixel_size` from the QC-measured mean subject height and stores it in the scale profile. Later actions processed with that profile reuse the exact pixel size, so crouching, recoil, hurt, and creature silhouette changes remain real pose changes instead of being normalized back to the reference height. The contract also converts the shared output origin to Godot's `Sprite3D.offset`, lists animation frames, and records timing. Reuse the same `world_height` and scale profile for every compatible action in one bundle.

After all actions pass QC, build one Godot animation bundle:

```bash
python scripts/generate2dsprite.py build-godot-bundle \
  --action idle=<bundle>/idle/godot-sprite3d.json \
  --action move=<bundle>/move/godot-sprite3d.json \
  --action attack=<bundle>/attack/godot-sprite3d.json \
  --action hurt=<bundle>/hurt/godot-sprite3d.json \
  --default-action idle --one-shot attack --one-shot hurt \
  --output <bundle>/godot-sprite3d-bundle.json
```

The bundle validates cross-action world height and `pixel_size`, stores relative contract paths, and declares loop versus one-shot playback. Treat a bundle drift failure as an asset-generation or wrong-profile error; do not compensate with per-action runtime scale.

### 5. QC the result

Check:

- did any frame touch the cell edge
- did any frame resize differently than intended
- did detached effects become noise
- does the sheet still read as one coherent animation
- for hero/player body actions, does the body height match the accepted idle/run scale within roughly 10-15%
- for fixed-cell runtimes, did a wide weapon trail or FX arc shrink the body inside the cell
- for preserve-scale runs, are feet/bottom anchors aligned without any `paste_clamped` frames
- for grounded high-value body sheets, does `qc_summary.body_scale_cv` stay at or below about `0.08` and `qc_summary.anchor_y_std` at or below about `0.05`
- does the subject slide sideways: `qc_summary.axis_x_std` should stay at or below about `0.01` of the cell width after stabilization
- was the raw sheet already well centered: compare `qc_summary.pre_stabilize_axis_x_std` against `axis_x_std`, and treat a large `stabilize_max_shift_px` as a regeneration signal even when the stabilized output passes
- did stabilization run out of room: any `stabilize_clamped_frames` means the correction was capped, not completed
- for rooted boss idles, do the feet and pelvis remain fixed while motion comes from compression, glow, shoulders, and attached secondary elements
- for ground-contact FX, is the authored ignition/baseline stable even when flame tips, embers, or effect height change
- for multi-action bundles, does `qc_summary.profile_body_scale_drift` stay within the scale profile limit, normally `0.08`

If not, rerun with different processor settings or regenerate the raw sheet.

Strict QC distinguishes raw source-cell contact from processed output contact. Prefer regeneration when a body part is visibly clipped. If visual review confirms the raw subject is complete and only an antialiased or harmless contour touches the source-cell boundary, use `--allow-source-edge-touch`; it never permits output-edge contact, paste clamping, or empty frames.

For elongated creature attacks, any `paste_clamped_frames` or `output_edge_touch_frames` means the raw sheet must be regenerated with the shared-silhouette-envelope contract above. Do not use `--allow-source-edge-touch` until clamp and processed-output edge contact are both zero and visual review confirms the full snout, paws, weapon, wings, or tail are intact.

For grounded high-value humanoid player/hero body actions, run strict QC after generation-first scale control:

```bash
python scripts/generate2dsprite.py process \
  --input <raw-sheet.png> \
  --target player \
  --mode attack \
  --output-dir <out-dir> \
  --rows 2 \
  --cols 3 \

These numeric gates are for grounded humanoid body actions, not jumps, knockback, projectiles, impacts, floating actors, creatures whose attack strongly changes silhouette/posture, or intentionally changing-scale FX. A failed gate is a regeneration signal; do not hide generation drift with per-frame scale normalization.

For ground-contact FX, prefer `component_mode=largest` when detached embers would corrupt the contact anchor. Accept a looser action-specific `max_anchor_y_std` only after visual review confirms a fixed baseline, zero output-edge contact, zero paste clamping, and correct in-engine placement. Do not loosen the grounded-character defaults globally.

Cross-action scale-profile drift is a generation QC signal. Preserve legitimate crouching, recoil, and compressed pose bboxes; inspect borderline hurt or knockback sheets visually instead of applying per-frame resize. For ordinary idle, run, walk, and grounded body attacks, reject unexplained profile drift.

### 6. Return the right bundle

For a single sheet, expect:

- `raw-sheet.png`
- `raw-sheet-clean.png`
- `sheet-transparent.png`
- frame PNGs
- `animation.gif`
- `prompt-used.txt`
- `pipeline-meta.json`
- optional `godot-sprite3d.json` when `--godot-world-height` is supplied
- `godot-sprite3d-bundle.json` for a multi-action Godot unit

For `player_sheet`, expect:

- transparent 4x4 sheet
- 16 frame PNGs
- direction strips
- 4 direction GIFs

For `spell_bundle` or `unit_bundle`, create one folder per asset in the bundle.

For `hero_action_bundle`, expect:

- one raw and processed sheet per action
- per-action frame PNGs and GIFs for visual QC
- separate projectile / muzzle / slash / impact assets when the hero shoots, casts, or uses wide melee effects
- optional assembled `engine-atlas-transparent.png` only after per-action QC passes
- one shared `character-scale-profile.json` for grounded body actions when cross-action scale consistency matters

## Defaults

- `idle`
  - small or medium actor -> `2x2`
  - large creature or boss -> `3x3`
- `cast` -> prefer `2x3`
- `projectile` -> prefer `2x2` for short animated loops; use row strips only when the engine specifically requires a strip, and assemble that strip after QC when practical
- `impact` / `explode` -> prefer `2x2`
- `walk`
  - topdown actor -> `4x4` for four-direction walk
  - side-view asset -> `2x2`
- controllable hero or main player with multiple actions -> `hero_action_bundle`
  - generate one action per raw multi-row grid sheet, not as a raw `1x4` strip
  - attack/shoot/cast body sheets are body-only by default; wide slash arcs, muzzle flashes, projectiles, trails, dust, and hit impacts are separate FX/projectile/impact sheets
  - if the weapon must stay integrated and there is no separate FX layer, use `--scale-strategy preserve --align feet` instead of bbox-fit normalization
  - default 4-frame action grid is `2x2`
  - use `2x3` for 6-frame actions and `2x4`, `3x3`, `3x4`, or `4x4` for longer actions
  - do not generate a mixed-action raw `4x4`, `5x5`, or custom atlas
  - assemble the final atlas only as a deterministic delivery step if the game requires it
- `4x4`, `5x5`, and custom grids
  - use as raw generation only for one coherent long action sequence, canonical directional locomotion, prop packs, or tileset-like atlases
  - use as delivery atlases for mixed actions only after separate action sheets pass QC
- `stabilize_axis=core-register` is the processor default and applies to every processed sheet; override with `none` only for projectiles, impacts, and FX whose horizontal travel is the animation
- use `shared_scale` by default for any multi-frame asset where frame-to-frame consistency matters
- use `largest` component mode for hero/player body grids; use `all` for separate FX/projectile/impact sheets
- use `scale_strategy=preserve` for grounded hero/player melee attacks with integrated weapons or wide body poses that would shrink under bbox-fit normalization; use `fit` for normal compact sheets and FX
